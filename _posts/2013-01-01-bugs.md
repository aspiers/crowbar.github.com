## Filing Defects
If you would like to open a defect you have an enhancement request, please use the project [GitHub Issues Tracker]( https://github.com/crowbar/crowbar/issues ).  Please do not open issues against individual barclamps, we are currently consolidating defects against the parent Crowbar project.  This may change in the future. Also please make sure to use the following template:
